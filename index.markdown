We all love to relax and chat with friends. Who doesn't love a cold brew ? Drinking beer with people is an important social ritual that is often linked to many memories (or the absence of it), especially of our younger days. EPFL is a highly international institution with people from all around the world. They leave their home countries behind to join EPFL but what if we could bring them back a bit of it ? We decided to match beers from SAT, our beloved bar, to the countries where they would be the most appreciated, to recommend them to people missing home and hope it might cure a bit of this homesickness !
